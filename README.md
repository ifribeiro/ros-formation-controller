# ros-formation-controller
Formation controller of two drones (Bebop2) implemented in Python with the [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) framework.

This project was the result of the final project of the Mobile Robotics class, which I did in 2019, in the Electrical Engineering Department at [UFES](http://www.ufes.br/).

The simulation was made using the [Parrot-Sphinx Simulator](https://developer.parrot.com/docs/sphinx/) and for the test I use two drones avaliable at the Lab.
